==> META TAGS -----------------------------

    Viewport <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    Viewport meta tag is necessary because it instructs web browsers (mainly mobile web browsers) on how to render a webpage on all 
    devices.

    Author and Copyright 
    <meta name="author" content="Name of the author" />
    <meta name="copyright" content="Copyright information" />
    Author and copyright met tags are used to record information such as the creator of the website and the copyright ownership 
    information.

    Robots
    Robots meta tag is used to provide index information to search engine crawlers. The following meta tags are used to determine 
    whether a page is available for a web search 
    <meta name="robots" content="follow"/>

    Index:
    This allows the web crawlers to index your webpage. The value follow also makes sure that any outgoing hyperlinks are also crawled.
    <meta name="robots" content="follow"/>

    Noindex
    It is the opposite of Index. It tells web crawlers not to index your webpage.
    <meta name="robots" content="noindex"/>

    Nofollow
    It prevents web crawlers from indexing outgoing hyperlinks on your web page.
    <meta name="robots" content="nofollow"/>

    Character encoding  <meta charset="UTF-8">
    Web browsers understand need the character encoding information to display a webpage correctly. To define the character encoding 
    we use charset attribute and assign it with an appropriate value. The most common character encoding used is the UTF-8. We use
    UTF-8 because it has more than 10,000 characters.

    Http equivalents
    http-equivalents attribute is used to include information that is usually contained in HTTP header. It is used to control cache 
    information,
    expiration date, refresh page redirection and much more.


    Cache control
    When we use the meta tag “cache-control” with the value “no-cache”, we prevent caching of the webpage and that means the webpage 
    is reloaded for every page view. This may lead to longer loading times but is helpful in cases where webpage is being updated 
    frequently. 
    <meta http-equiv="cache-control" content="no-cache"/>

    Expires
    We can set expiry date for the webpage data instead of preventing caching completely.
    <meta http-equiv="expires" content="4500"/>
    <meta http-equiv="expires" content="Thu, 06 Aug 2020 20:13:13 GMT"/>

    Refresh
    Instead of using complicated ways of redirecting web pages using JavaScript or other programming languages. HTML provides a much
    more succinct and simple solution. To redirect a webpage, we need three attributes set to:
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="time(seconds); url=http://www.your-website.com/"/>

    Keywords
    We can search using keywords in a search engine. Searching using keywords will show the internet user web webpages with keywords
    corresponding to their search.
    <meta name="keywords" content="keyword #1, keyword #2, keyword #3"/>

    DOCTYPE for reading the document. If a user agent doesn't recognize a correct DOCTYPE, it will trigger the quirks mode.

    Quirks mode was to support websites built before standards became widely implemented. quirks mode in browser allows u to render

    A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
    Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

    Search Engine Optimization, accessibility, repurposing, light code. Many visually impaired person rely on browser speech and 
    semantic tag helps to interpret page content clearly. Search engine needs to understand page content to rank and semantic tag helps.
    Semantic HTML is the practice of using more descriptive and meaningful tags when coding in HTML. A tag is simply anything you use to
    wrap content in. Some of the most common are <h1>, <header>, <footer>, <p>, <section>, <nav>, and <div>.

    about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile 
    devices, or those with slow network connections.

    Accessibility can be viewed as the "ability to access" and benefit from some system or entity. The concept focuses on enabling 
    access for people with disabilities, or enabling access through the use of assistive technology; however, research and development 
    in accessibility brings benefits to everyone.

    What do we mean by accessibility?
    Accessibility refers to how software or hardware combinations are designed to make a system accessible to persons with disabilities,
    such as visual impairment, hearing loss, or limited dexterity.

    Accessibility means that people can do what they need to do in a similar amount of time and effort as someone that does not have a
    disability. It means that people are empowered, can be independent, and will not be frustrated by something that is poorly designed
    or implemented
