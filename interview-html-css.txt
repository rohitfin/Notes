    What Is A CSS Reset? (make consistency on all browser so reset default values)
    resets the styling of all HTML elements to a consistent baseline
    CSS resets aim to remove all built-in browser styling. For example margins, paddings, font-sizes of all elements are reset to be
    the same. 

        In case you didn’t know, every browser has its own default ‘user agent’ stylesheet, that it uses to make unstyled 
        websites appear more legible. For example, most browsers by default make links blue and visited links purple, give
        tables a certain amount of border and padding, apply variable font-sizes to H1, H2, H3 etc. and a certain amount of
        padding to almost everything. Ever wondered why Submit buttons look different in every browser?

    what is opacity in css
    The CSS opacity property is used to specify the transparency of an element.

    what is margin in css
    used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders

    what is padding in css
    padding is the space between an element's border and the element's content.

    What is the difference between a class and an ID?
    Class is a way of using HTML elements for styling. They are not unique and have multiple elements.  
    ID is unique and it can be assigned to a single element. 

    Is CSS faster than sass?
    CSS sends an HTTP request to server each time to import a file. Sass does it without an HTTP request, which is a faster approach.

    in button 
    we have to use (padding)em instead of px and for margin rem consistence spacing. in rem, R stand for root. pixels are solid unit 
    they are not changed.

    Explicit and Implicit Grid
    When we use grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows we create an Explicit Grid. However if we try and place an item outside of 
    that grid the browser will create an Implicit Grid line or lines in order to hold that item.

    CSS Flexbox or Grid ?
    Flexbox is mainly meant for 1-dimensional layouts while Grid is meant for 2-dimensional layouts.

    Flexbox
    It comes in handy when you need to create a responsive web design.
    Flexbox is a CSS3 layout model that solves usually tricky problems including how to position, center or dynamically resize elements
    on a page. it a great tool to use for responsive design systems.

    What is grid area CSS?
    The grid-area CSS shorthand property specifies a grid item's size and location within a grid by contributing a line, a span

    Does CSS grid replace Flexbox?
    Grid is better than flexbox for a number of valid points. Furthermore, Grid uses the auto layout, minmax(), repeat(), and auto-fill
    which can provide responsive media query alternative. Flexbox is essentially for laying out items in a single dimension – in a 
    row OR a column

    What Are Pseudo-elements?
    Pseudo-elements are fictional elements that do not exist in HTML.

    What you mean by pseudo classes in CSS?
    Pseudo classes will allow you to identify the HTML elements
    Pseudo class is a style element. It works when the element goes on focus like when we mouse over a button, and it changes its color 
    and the color of visited and unvisited sites.

    What is pseudo element? what is pseudo class?
    pseudo elements helps you to add cosmetics contents. pseudo elements generates content where as pseudo class deals with state of 
    the element

    What Are The Components Of A Css Style?
    Selector, Property, Value 

    what is caret-color property in css
    the text input cursor.the caret is typically a thin vertical line that flashes to help make it more noticeable.

    Describe ‘ruleset’?
    Ruleset : Selectors can be attached to other selectors to be identified by ruleset.
    It has two parts:
    Selector, e.g. id or classname
    declaration {text-indent: 11pt}

    Why We Use 'clear' In Html?
    We use the clearance in HTML code for separating the content from one <div> content after floating the position of other<div> content.

    What is CSS float?
    It describes how the element should be placed either left or right of the container.
    The float CSS property places an element on the left or right side of its container.
    The float property is used for positioning the HTML elements horizontally either towards the left or right of the container.

    what is clear?
    Do not allow floating elements on the left or the right side of a specified element. The clear CSS property sets whether an element
    must be moved below (cleared) floating elements that precede it. The clear property applies to floating and non-floating elements.
    clear: none|left|right|both|initial|inherit;

    What is a Clearfix?
    A clearfix is a way for an element to automatically clear or fix its elements, so that do not need to add additional markup. It is
    generally used in float layout where elements are floated to be stacked horizontally.
    .clearfix::after {
            content: "";
            clear: both;
            display: table;
        }

    How to target the first 4 elements of a list?
    .selector:nth-child(-n+4){}

    What Are The Five Possible Values For "position"?
    Values for position: static, relative, absolute, fixed, inherit.

    What Is Property?
    Property is a stylistic parameter (attribute) that can be influenced through CSS, e.g. FONT or WIDTH. 

    What Is Initial Value?
    Initial value is a default value of the property, that is the value given to the root element of the document tree. 
    All properties have an initial value.

    How To Page Break After An Html Element In Css?
    <p style=”page-break-after: always’>Place your text</p>

    What property is not affected by CSS3 transitions?
    font-style

    Which of listed CSS properties are inherited?
    position
    font-size
    color
    background-color

    Define CSS image sprites.
    CSS image sprites are a group of images that are placed into one image. It reduces the load time and request number to the server
    while projecting multiple images into a single web page.

    integrate CSS
    Inline method,Embedded/Internal method,Linked/Imported/External method

    Can you explain CSS box model?
    The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the 
    actual content.

    display block
    take up as much width as they are allowed and typically start on a new line.

    What is the display block?
    Block: Displays an element as a block element. It starts on a new line and takes up take up as much horizontal space as they can. 

    What is display inline CSS?
    only takes up as much width as necessary. does not start on a new line. top and bottom margins are restricted. 

    Inline Block Elements: Inline-block elements are similar to inline elements, except they can have padding and margins and set 
    height and width values.

    border-box
    The border-box property includes the content, padding and border in the height and width properties. 

    Different Box Sizing Property?
    The box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.
    The box-sizing CSS property sets how the total width and height of an element are calculated.
    Content-box: The default width and height values apply to the element's content only. The padding and border are added to the 
    outside of the box.
    Padding-box: Width and height values apply to the element's content and its padding. The border is added to the outside of the box.
    Currently, only Firefox supports the padding-box value.
    Border-box: Width and height values apply to the content, padding, and border

    What is Z index in CSS?
    z-index is used for specifying the vertical stacking of the overlapping elements.
    The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element. An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element
    with a lower stack order.
    Z index helps in specifying the overlapping element. It is a number which can be positive or negative, the default value being zero.

    What is aspect ratio CSS?
    The aspect ratio of an element describes the proportional relationship between its width and its height. ratio value representing 
    the width-to-height aspect ratio of the viewport. It is a range feature, meaning you can also use the prefixed min-aspect-ratio and 
    max-aspect-ratio variants to query minimum and maximum  values, respectively.

    width: max-content;
        not wrap

    visibility hidden vs display none
        is not visible, but space is allocated for it on the page.
        is not visible,also not allocated space on the page.

    What is new in CSS?
    It brings a lot of new features and additions, like rounded corners, shadows, gradients, transitions or animations, as well as new
    layouts like multi-columns, flexible box or grid layouts. grid, Flexbox gaps,The :is() and :where() pseudo-classes, Advanced 
    Animations, Multiple Backgrounds & Gradient, HSL RGBA, HSLA and the gradient colors, text-shadows, Multiple Column layouts, Opacity, 
    Rounded Corner

    What are the new color properties in CSS3?
    HSLA (Hue-saturation-lightness-alpha), HSL, and RGBA (red green blue alpha.).

    What is the use of calc()?
    The calc() function in CSS3 is used for simple calculations to determine CSS property values present right in CSS. It allows 
    mathematical expressions with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to be used as component values.

    Inline Elements
    ignore top and bottom margin, but apply left and right margins, and any padding Will ignore the width and height properties

    Does setting margin-top and margin-bottom have an affect on an inline element?
    No, Top and bottom margins do not affect inline elements because inline elements flow with content on the page. width, height, 
    margin-bottom, margin-top not working in this property.

    What is the recommended order for styling an <a> tag?
    a:link { } , a:visited { } , a:hover { } , a:active { }

    How do I override a CSS class to another?
    Add another CSS rule with ! important , and either give the selector a higher specificity or add a CSS rule with the same selector
    at a later point than the existing one.

    What does important do in CSS?
    This rule overrides all previous styling rules 

    How do I ignore a class in CSS?, How to exclude particular class name from CSS selector ?
    we can use the pseudo-class :not selector

    How is the concept of inheritance applied in CSS?
    In CSS, inheritance controls what happens when no value is specified for a property on an element.

    List out some of the properties in added in CSS3?
    Border Images, New Web fonts, Multi Column layout, Box Shadows, Text Shadows, Transform property, Word-wrap, Text-overflow, 
    Word- break

    PX: Pixels (px) are considered absolute units, although they are relative to the DPI and resolution of the viewing device. But on
    the device itself, the PX unit is fixed and does not change based on any other element. Using PX can be problematic for responsive
    sites, but they are useful for maintaining consistent sizing for some elements. If you have elements that should not be resized, 
    then using PX is a good choice.
    EM: Relative to the parent element
    REM: Relative to the root element (HTML tag) [R stands for root]
    %: Relative to the parent element
    VW: Relative to the viewport’s width
    VH: Relative to the viewport’s height

    What is the difference between em and rem units?
    em units inherit their value from the nearest parent element
    rem units inherit their value from the root element (html)
    In most browsers, the font-size of the root element is set to 16px by default.

    What is the difference between REM and em and px?
    px is not scalable, it is an absolute unit. ... Element ( em ) and Root element ( rem ) are responsive units interpreted into
    equivalent px unit by the browser. em is Relative to the parent element, rem Relative to the root element

    What is the difference between span and div?
    div is a block element and span is inline element.

    What is the origin of CSS?
    SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) 

    What's the difference between a relative, fixed, absolute and statically positioned element?
    static - The default position; the element will flow into the page as it normally would. relative - The element's position is 
        adjusted relative to itself, without changing layout 
    absolute - The element is removed from the flow of the page and positioned at a specified position relative to its closest 
        positioned ancestor if any.
    fixed - The element is removed from the flow of the page and positioned at a specified position relative to the viewport and 
        doesn't move when scrolled.
    sticky - Sticky positioning is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. The element is treated as relative positioned until 
        it crosses a specified threshold, at which point it is treated as fixed positioned.

    What is transition all in CSS?
    it provide a way to control animation speed when changing CSS properties. CSS transitions allows you to change property values 
    smoothly, over a given duration.

    What is the transform in CSS?
    This property allows you to rotate, scale, move, skew, etc., elements.It applies a 2D or 3D transformation to an element. 

    what is hyphens?
    is allowed to create more soft wrap opportunities within a line of text.
        hyphens: none|manual|auto|initial|inherit;

    what is word-wrap?
    property allows long words to be able to be broken and wrap onto the next
        word-wrap: normal|break-word|initial|inherit;
        
    what is word-break?
    how words should break when reaching the end of a line.
        word-break: normal|break-all|keep-all|break-word|initial|inherit;

    what is outline?
    Outline differs from borders! Unlike border, the outline is drawn outside the element's border, and may overlap other content. 
    Also, the outline is NOT a part of the element's dimensions; the element's total width and height is not affected by the width 
    of the outline.

    font-kerning
    Kerning defines how letters are spaced.For fonts that do not include kerning data, this property will have no visible effect.

    What do you understand by tweening in CSS?
    Tweening is the process of filling the gaps between the key sequences, i.e between the keyframes that are already created. Keyframes
    are those frames that represent start and end point of animation action. Tweening involves generating intermediate keyframes between
    two images that give the impression that the first one has evolved smoothly to the second image. For this purpose, we use properties
    like  transforms - matrix, translate, scale, rotate etc.

    What is RWD?
    RWD is the abbreviated form of Responsive Web Design. It is used to display the designed page suitably on any kind of screen size 
    depending on the device under consideration.

    What is difference between ID selector and class selector in CSS?
    “id” is unique in a page and can only apply to at most one element, while “class” selector can apply to multiple elements.
    id is used for single elements that appear on the page for only once (e.g. header, footer, menu), whereas class is used for 
    single or multiple elements that appear on the page for once or more than once 



    ::before / ::after
    The ::before and ::after pseudo-elements in CSS allows you to insert content onto a page without it needing to be in the HTML.
    While the end result is not actually in the DOM

    :active
    The :active pseudo selector changes the appearance of a link while it is being activated (being clicked on or otherwise activated).
    It’s usually only seen for a split second, and provides visual feedback that the element was indeed clicked.

    :any-link
    The :any-link pseudo-class in CSS provides a method for selecting elements that are the source anchor of a hyperlink.An element 
    that accepts and contains a href attribute is a hyperlink and will be selected with :any-link. This becomes a handy way of 
    selecting all link.
    :matches(:link, :visited) will select the same elements as :any-link.
    :-webkit-any-link {
    }

    :blank (no support)
    The :blank pseudo-class builds upon the :empty pseudo-class. Like :empty, :blank will select elements that contain nothing at all,
    or contain only an HTML comment. But, :blank will also select elements that include whitespace, which :empty will not.
    :-moz-only-whitespace

    :empty
    select elements that contain either nothing

    :dir() -(only firefox support)
    :dir(rtl) {}

    :disabled / :enabled
    used in input 
    <input type="text" disabled>

    ::first-letter
    which allows you to style the first letter in an element.

    ::first-line
    which allows you to style the first line in an element.

    :first-child
    target the first element immediately inside another element.
    
    :first-of-type  /  :last-of-type
    allows you to target the first occurence of an element within its container.

    :in-range /   :out-of-range
    in CSS matches input elements when their value is within the range specified as being acceptable.
    <input max="10" min="5" type="number">

    :indeterminate
    selector in CSS named for a state that is neither checked nor unchecked. It’s that in-between state that we might consider 
    the “Maybe” between “Yes” and “No” options. The state is not fully determined, hence the name: indeterminate.

    :is / :where
        both pseudo-class functions that can help shorten and stop repetition in creating your selectors.
    The pseudo-select :is() in CSS allows you to write compound selectors more tersely.
    ul li, ol li {}
        :is(ul, ol) li {}
    ul li a:hover, ol li a:hover {}
        :is(ul li, ol li) a:hover{}

    What is the difference between :is & :where?
        they have different specificities. :where() is simple and always has a specificity of 0 while :is() 
        has the specificity of the strongest/most specific selector.


    ::marker
    for styling the stylistic marker of a list element. For example, the bullet point of a 
    default <ul> (e.g. •) or the numeral of a default <ol> (e.g. 1.). 

    ::placeholder
    allows you to style the placeholder text of a form element.
    ::-webkit-input-placeholder { /* Chrome/Opera/Safari */}
    ::-moz-placeholder { /* Firefox 19+ */}
    :-ms-input-placeholder { /* IE 10+ */}
    :-moz-placeholder { /* Firefox 18- */}

    :placeholder-shown
    selects the input element itself when placeholder text exists in a form input.

    :root
    The :root selector allows you to target the highest-level “parent” element in the DOM, or document tree.


    Explain CSS3 Selectors.
        Universal Selector, 
        ID Selector, 
        Element Type Selector, 
        Class Selector, 
        Child selector  (>), 
        Descendant selector  (space), 
        General Sibling selector  (~), 
        Adjacent Sibling selector  (+), 
        Attribute Selector, 
        Pseudo-element

    Which CSS property is used for controlling the layout?
    display property, The display property is the most important CSS property for controlling layout.

    What Is A Css File? It Is Used For What Purpose?
    CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets", and are used to control and manage font styles, font sizes, and web site color combinations
    that are used in a web page. In order to retain continuity of "look and feel" throughout a website, all pages within a website will
    often refer to a single CSS file.

    What are the media types?
    It has a total of 10 media types supported it. Here are those:
        All - Intended for all devices
        Braille - Braille tactile feedback devices

        Projection – Used for projected presentations

    @charset — Defines the character set used by the style sheet.
    
    @import — Tells the CSS engine to include an external style sheet.
    @media — A conditional group rule that will apply its content if the device meets the criteria of the condition defined using a media query.
    @supports — A conditional group rule that will apply its content if the browser meets the criteria of the given condition.
    @document  — A conditional group rule that will apply its content if the document in which the style sheet is applied meets 
        the criteria of the given condition. (deferred to Level 4 of CSS Spec)
    @page — Describes the aspect of layout changes that will be applied when printing the document.
    @font-face — Describes the aspect of an external font to be downloaded.
    @keyframes — Describes the aspect of intermediate steps in a CSS animation sequence.
    @viewport  — Describes the aspects of the viewport for small screen devices.

==> SASS -----------------------------
    What is SASS programming?
    Sass (First appeared	November 28, 2006, latest version 3.5. 7 - July 18, 2018 (313 KB))
    Sass (which stands for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is an extension to CSS. ... Saas includes various features such as 
    variables, nested rules, mixins, inline imports, built-in functions to manipulate color and other values, all with a fully 
    CSS-compatible syntax. Sass is a style sheet language initially designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum. 
    Sass is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). SassScript is the 
    scripting language itself. Sass consists of two syntaxes. The original syntax, called "the indented syntax," uses a syntax similar
    to Haml.

    What is the benefit of using sass?
    Advantages. Sass facilitates you to write clean, easy and less CSS in a programming construct. It contains fewer codes so you can 
    write CSS quicker.It is more stable, powerful, and elegant because it is an extension of CSS.

    What is a Sass mixin?
    Mixins allow you to define styles that can be re-used throughout your stylesheet.
    Mixins allow you to group multiple lines of code together that you can reuse throughout your code.
    @mixin horizontal-list { }
        nav ul { @include horizontal-list; }

    What is the difference between SCSS and sass?
    The basic difference is the syntax. While SASS has a loose syntax with white space and no semicolons, the SCSS resembles more to 
    CSS. SASS stands for Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets. SCSS --Sassy CSS

    What is the use of Sass @import function?
    SASS @import directive is used to include one stylesheet inside another stylesheet

    What is the use of @extend function in Sass?
    By using @extend function same style can be copied to the other classes also and there is no need to rewrite the code again.
    
    Explain how to define a variable in Sass?
    Variables in Sass begin with a ($) sign and variable assignment is done with a colon(:).

    Explain when can you use the %placeholders in Sass?
    %placeholders in Sass is useful when you want to write styles that were meant to be extended, but you don’t want the base styles 
    to be seen in output CSS styles

    Explain what is the use of &combinator ?
    &combinator concatenates nested selector with the parent selector.

    Partials and Importing
    SASS partials allow us to break up our files into smaller files. We can essentially modularize CSS to make more maintainable code. 
    You can create a partial file that only contains relevant code per section. This is useful if your SASS file is getting too large.


    What is the advantage of sass?
