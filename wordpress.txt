    What is WordPress?
    WordPress is an Open Source Content Management System (CMS) and a blogging tool, based on PHP and MySQL. It is free of cost, and
    you can use it for any personal and commercial website. WordPress was initially released on 27th May 2003 by Matt Mullenweg and 
    Mike Little. WordPress was announced as open source in October 2009.


    What is child theme in wordpress?
    A child theme in WordPress is a sub theme that inherits all the functionality, features, and style of its parent theme.  Child themes
    are a safe way to modify a WordPress theme without actually making any changes to the parent theme's files. Child themes are often
    used when you want to customize or tweak an existing WordPress theme without losing the ability  to upgrade that theme.

    Is Child Theme necessary?
    Those updates are the reason to use a child theme. But if you have nothing specific to change for the theme you are using, then no
    child theme is needed.

    What is a parent theme?
    A parent theme in WordPress is a theme that is declared parent by a another theme, child theme. ... The parent/child theme 
    functionality allows users to easily upgrade their themes without worrying about losing any custom styling that they have added
    to their site.

        There are two types of hooks:
        Action hooks: Action hooks facilitate you to insert an additional code from an outside resource.

    How many tables are there in WordPress by default?
        At present version, there are about 11 tables in WordPress by default. You can check the number of tables in WordPress by

    comment moderation setting, select Settings option from the dashboard and check the option "Comment must be manually approved."

    Explain Avatar and Gravatar in WordPress.
    Word Avatar is used for a user's profile image in online communications. Gravatar is a web-based service which allows its users
    to use
    the Avatar image. 

    How many types of users WordPress have?
        WordPress user role determines access permission to the users of a WordPress site.
            Administrator: They have full rights over a site.
            Editor: They deal with the content section of a website.
            Author: They only deal with their posts. They can delete their post even after publishing.
            Contributor: A contributor doesn't have the right to publish their post or page. They need to send it to the administrator
            for review.
            Subscriber: Users who are subscribed to your site can log in and update their profile.
            Follower: They don't have any right. They can only read and comment on your post.
            Viewer: They can only read and comment on a post.

    Explain the difference between WordPress Themes and Plugins.
    A theme is an external effect of a website's presentation and designing. Whereas, a plugin is an interior effect which adds or 
    remove some functions to a site. You can customize some functionality in themes instead of installing the plugin, but plugins
    can't replace themes.
