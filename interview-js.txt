==> JQUERY -----------------------------

    What is jQuery and why it is used?
    Introduced in 2006, jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.  It is free, open-source.
    The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.
    jQuery makes event handling, DOM manipulation, Ajax calls much easier than JavaScript.
    jQuery also allows us to add animated effects on our web page which takes a lot of pain and lines of code with JavaScript.

    jQuery is a small yet feature-rich powerful javascript library that helps to manipulate the HTML DOM with less javascript code.


    Is Jquery Code Executed On The Client side, Or Server side?
    Answer : Client side

    window.onload() - https://www.dotnetbull.com/2013/08/document-ready-vs-window-onload.html
    The load event fires when all the content on your page fully loaded including the DOM 
    (document object model) content, asynchronous javascript, frames and images

    $(window).load(function () { alert("window load complete"); });
    window.onload = function () {alert("window load complete"); }

    $document.ready() -
    Jquery $document.ready function event executes a bit earlier than window.onload and called once the  DOM(Document object model) is
    loaded on your page. DOM means all the html tags/script  I.e.(anchor tag, table, div tag, paragraph tag etc..). It will not wait 
    for the images, frames to get fully load. It means that it is the earliest stage in page load process.

    The main difference is that $document.ready() event gets called as soon as your DOM is loaded.  It does not wait for the contents 
    to get loaded fully. For example, there are very heavy images  on any web page and takes time to load. If you have used window.onload
    then it will wait until  all your images are loaded fully, hence it slows down the execution. On the other side,  $document.ready()
    does not wait for elements to get loaded.

    What’s the difference between window.onload vs document.onload?
    window.onload is fired when the DOM is ready and all the content including images, CSS, scripts, subframes, etc. finish loaded.
    It means that everything is loaded.
    document.onload is fired when the DOM is ready, which can be before images and other external content is loaded.

    Is Ajax a framework?
        AJAX. OOP, an open source framework, it provides an OOP-style programming engine and Ajax requests-handling functionality

        $.ajax({
            url: '',
            type: 'get',
            error: function(e){ console.log(e);},
            success: function(res){
                console.log(res);
            }
        });

    What’s the fastest way to query DOM?
        The fastest way to select an element is by ID if the ID exists.
        The second quickest is getElementByClassName .
        The longer the selector, the slower it will be.
        querySelectorAll will be the slowest since it has to search for all kinds of CSS selectors.
        Other methods like getElementById and getElementsByTagName only search for specific kinds of selectors.

    What is GET Method? 
    GET is used to request data from a specified resource. It appends form-data to the URL in name/ value pairs. The length of the URL
    is limited by 2048 characters. This method must not be used if you have a password or some sensitive information to be sent to the
    server. It is used for submitting the form where the user can bookmark the result.
        GET requests can be cached
        GET requests remain in the browser history
        GET requests can be bookmarked
        GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data
        GET requests have length restrictions
        GET requests are only used to request data (not modify)

    What is POST Method? 
    POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.
        POST requests are never cached
        POST requests do not remain in the browser history
        POST requests cannot be bookmarked
        POST requests have no restrictions on data length

==> JAVASCRIPT -----------------------------

    What is JavaScript and why it is used?
    JavaScript is a very powerful client-side and server-side scripting language.This allows us to create dynamic content for the web. JavaScript is a 
    lightweight language that is open-source and allows cross-platform.it works with various other programming languages And this is 
    the reason for its vast use all around the world.

    the code is always visible to everyone anyone can view JavaScript code

    var
    var is function scoped, can be re-declared and re-assign. access 'var' before initialization gives 'undefined' (means hoisting)

        console.log(a); // hoisting 
        var a = 10;
        var a = 20; // re-declared
        a = 30; // re-assigning

    let 
    block level scope, can not re-declared but re-assign. let variables can be updated but not re-declared.Cannot access 'let' before 
    initialization gives 'error' (means hoisting)

    const 
    block level scope, const variables can neither be re-assign nor re-declared. Cannot access 'const' before initialization gives 
    'error' (means hoisting)

    function 
    A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. It is a group of reusable code that you can use
    anywhere in the code. It helps you to divide a large program into small and manageable functions.

        Function Expressions
            variable = function (parameters){ //expression };

    Variable Scope
        Scope refers to the availability of variables and functions in certain parts of the code.
        Global Scope => A variable declared at the top of a program or outside of a function is considered a global scope variable.
        Local Scope => A variable can also have a local scope, i.e it can only be accessed within a function.

    Is Const faster than let?
    It appears that using const would inherently make code a little faster, because it seems to reduce the amount of hoisting necessary. 

    What Are Javascript Types?
    Number, String, Boolean, Function, Object, Null, Undefined.

    What Is A Prompt Box?
    A prompt box allows the user to enter input by providing a text box.

    How Do You Convert Numbers to String In Javascript?
    Use the  toString()  function

    When is the mouseout event fired?
    When mouse is no longer over an element

    When is the mouseover event fired?
    When mouse is moved over a new element

    what is hoisting
    code execution before declarations. access them before they are declared. One of the benefits of hoisting is that it enables us 
    to call functions before they appear in the code. 

    What does != Mean in programming?
    not-equal-to operator. The not-equal-to operator ( != ) returns true if the operands don't have the same value; otherwise, it 
    returns false

    What is ++i in JavaScript? (bad ki Value)
        ++i is the value of i after the increment. 
            i = 42;
            alert(++i); // shows 43
            alert(i); // shows 43

    What is i++ in JavaScript? (Pehle ki value)
        The value i++ is the value of i before the increment.
            var i = 42;
            alert(i++); // shows 42
            alert(i); // shows 43

    diff between =, ==, ===
        = => assigning value
        == => comparing values
        === => comparing values and types

    what is array in javascript?
    array is collection of data. access  from index value. array can hold function. array is numeric index number. 
    in javascript array start with 0 (zero) index number. in single variable store multiple value is called
    array. ex:  var myArr = [1, 2, 'a', 'c'];

    split() => convert string to array, return new array. Not change original string.

    let text = "How are you doing today?";
    const arr = text.split(" ", 4); // ["How", "are", "you", "doing"]

    at();
    arr.at(2); // "you"; -> 2nd position value
    arr.at(); // "How"; -> First Value
    arr.at(-1); // "doing"; -> Last value

    contact(); => create new array, not change the existing arrays.

    fill() =>  fills specified elements in an array with a value, overwrite the original array.Start and end position can be specified. If not, all elements will be filled.
    arr.fill("Mike", 2, 4);

    flat() => concatenates sub-array elements
    const myArr = [1, 2, [3, [4, 5, 6], 7], 8];
    const newArr = myArr.flat(2); // 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8

    includes() => returns true if an array contains a specified value, returns false if the value is not found. is case sensitive
        const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
        fruits.includes("Mango"); // true

        fruits.includes("Banana", 3); // false


    what is object in javascript
    object is key value pair. access from .(dot) notation. object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association 
    between a key and a value.
        var myOb = {
            name: "cyclopes",
            rank: '2',
            power: ['one', 'two', 'three']
        }

    what is properties?
    properties are like variable attached to classes / object.

    what is method?
        methods are like function attached to classes / objects

    what destructuring?
    easily extract array element or object properties and store them in variables. Its allows to put out single elements or object 
    properties.

    What does callback function do?
    function call another function is called callback function. ex: setTimeout(), setInterval();
    A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to 
    complete some kind of routine or action.

    what is this keyword in javascript?
    The JavaScript this keyword refers to the object it belongs to. It has different values depending on where it is used: In a method, 
    this refers to the owner object. Alone, this refers to the global object. In a function, this refers to the global object.

    difference between typescript and javascript ?
    JavaScript is a scripting language. 
    typescript  is an object-oriented programming language and has a compiler.
    TypeScript is an object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft Corporation, whereas JavaScript is the programming language 
    for the web. TypeScript is an open-source language to build large-scale web apps, whereas JavaScript is a server-side programming language
    that helps to develop interactive web pages.

    Is TypeScript frontend or backend?
    Typescript is a programming language. You can use it for front end development (eg Angular) or backend development using Node js environment.

    what is class inheritance in javascript
    Inheritance enables you to define a class that takes all the functionality from a parent class and allows you to add more.
    Using class inheritance, a class can inherit all the methods and properties of another class.


    what is filter method  in javascript?
    The filter() method does not change the original array. Its return array values.
    The filter() function will return a new array containing all the array elements that pass the given condition. If no elements pass 
    the condition it returns an empty array.

        Let's go through step by step on how the filter() works.
            Create an empty array filterArr .
            Loop through the array elements.
            Called the filterFunc function with the current element as the argument.
            If the result is true, push the element to the filterArr array.
            Return filterArr array after going through all the elements.

    Spread Operator
    The spread operator ... is used to expand or spread an iterable or an array. ou can also use the spread syntax ... to copy the items into a single array.

    what is map method  in javascript?

    what is reduce method in javascript?
    The reduce method is applied to arrays in Javascript. reduce() method returns a single value

    what is promises in javascript?
    A promise in JavaScript is asynchronous, meaning it takes time to resolve or finish.
    A Promise represents something that is eventually fulfilled. A Promise can either be rejected or resolved based on the operation outcome.
    The code does not directly or immediately return a value.
    
    What is the difference between observable and promises?
    The biggest difference is that Promises won't change their value once they have been fulfilled. They can only emit (reject, resolve) a single
    value. On the other hand, observables can emit multiple results. The subscriber will be receiving results until the observer is completed or 
    unsubscribed from.

==> TYPE SCRIPT -----------------------------
    what is type script?
    typescript is not entirely new language, typescript super set of javascript that means any valid javascript code is also valid
    typescript code but typescript have additional features that do not exist in current version of javascript supported.
    typescript strong or static typing like #c and java language.

    Access modifiers
        1. Public
        2. Private
        3. Protected
