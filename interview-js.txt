==> JQUERY -----------------------------

    What is jQuery and why it is used?
    Introduced in 2006, jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.  It is free, open-source.
    The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.
    jQuery makes event handling, DOM manipulation, Ajax calls much easier than JavaScript.
    jQuery also allows us to add animated effects on our web page which takes a lot of pain and lines of code with JavaScript.

    jQuery is a small yet feature-rich powerful javascript library that helps to manipulate the HTML DOM with less javascript code.


    Is Jquery Code Executed On The Client side, Or Server side?
    Answer : Client side

    window.onload() - https://www.dotnetbull.com/2013/08/document-ready-vs-window-onload.html
    The load event fires when all the content on your page fully loaded including the DOM 
    (document object model) content, asynchronous javascript, frames and images

    $(window).load(function () { alert("window load complete"); });
    window.onload = function () {alert("window load complete"); }

    $document.ready() -
    Jquery $document.ready function event executes a bit earlier than window.onload and called once the  DOM(Document object model) is
    loaded on your page. DOM means all the html tags/script  I.e.(anchor tag, table, div tag, paragraph tag etc..). It will not wait 
    for the images, frames to get fully load. It means that it is the earliest stage in page load process.

    The main difference is that $document.ready() event gets called as soon as your DOM is loaded.  It does not wait for the contents 
    to get loaded fully. For example, there are very heavy images  on any web page and takes time to load. If you have used window.onload
    then it will wait until  all your images are loaded fully, hence it slows down the execution. On the other side,  $document.ready()
    does not wait for elements to get loaded.

    What’s the difference between window.onload vs document.onload?
    window.onload is fired when the DOM is ready and all the content including images, CSS, scripts, subframes, etc. finish loaded.
    It means that everything is loaded.
    document.onload is fired when the DOM is ready, which can be before images and other external content is loaded.

    Is Ajax a framework?
        AJAX. OOP, an open source framework, it provides an OOP-style programming engine and Ajax requests-handling functionality

        $.ajax({
            url: '',
            type: 'get',
            error: function(e){ console.log(e);},
            success: function(res){
                console.log(res);
            }
        });

    What’s the fastest way to query DOM?
        The fastest way to select an element is by ID if the ID exists.
        The second quickest is getElementByClassName .
        The longer the selector, the slower it will be.
        querySelectorAll will be the slowest since it has to search for all kinds of CSS selectors.
        Other methods like getElementById and getElementsByTagName only search for specific kinds of selectors.

    What is GET Method? 
    GET is used to request data from a specified resource. It appends form-data to the URL in name/ value pairs. The length of the URL
    is limited by 2048 characters. This method must not be used if you have a password or some sensitive information to be sent to the
    server. It is used for submitting the form where the user can bookmark the result.
        GET requests can be cached
        GET requests remain in the browser history
        GET requests can be bookmarked
        GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data
        GET requests have length restrictions
        GET requests are only used to request data (not modify)

    What is POST Method? 
    POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.
        POST requests are never cached
        POST requests do not remain in the browser history
        POST requests cannot be bookmarked
        POST requests have no restrictions on data length

==> JAVASCRIPT -----------------------------

    What is JavaScript and why it is used?
    JavaScript is a programming language used to make websites interactive and dynamic.
    JavaScript is a very powerful client-side and server-side scripting language.This allows us to create dynamic content for the web. 
    JavaScript is a lightweight language that is open-source and allows cross-platform. it works with various other programming languages
    And this is the reason for its vast use all around the world.

    the code is always visible to everyone, anyone can view JavaScript code

    var
    var is function scoped, can be re-declared and re-assign. access 'var' before initialization gives 'undefined' (means hoisting)

        console.log(a); // hoisting 
        var a = 10;
        var a = 20; // re-declared
        a = 30; // re-assigning

    let 
    block level scope, can not re-declared but re-assign. Cannot access 'let' before 
    initialization gives 'error' (means hoisting)

    const 
    block level scope, const variables can neither be re-assign nor re-declared. Cannot access 'const' before initialization gives 
    'error' (means hoisting)

    function 
    A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. It is a group of reusable code that you can use
    anywhere in the code. It helps you to divide a large program into small and manageable functions.

        Function Expressions
            variable = function (parameters){ //expression };

    Variable Scope
        Scope refers to the availability of variables and functions in certain parts of the code.
        Global Scope => A variable declared at the top of a program or outside of a function is considered a global scope variable.
        Local Scope => A variable can also have a local scope, i.e it can only be accessed within a function.

    Is Const faster than let?
    It appears that using const would inherently make code a little faster, because it seems to reduce the amount of hoisting necessary. 

    const use 
    we know the value should stay the same.
    Example: API keys, fixed settings, or names that don’t change.

    What Are Javascript Types?
    Number, String, Boolean, Function, Object, Null, Undefined.

    What Is A Prompt Box?
    A prompt box allows the user to enter input by providing a text box.

    What Is The Difference Between An Alert Box And A Confirmation Box?
    An alert box displays only one button which is the OK button whereas the Confirm box displays two buttons namely OK and cancel.

    When is the mouseOut event fired?
    When mouse is no longer over an element

    When is the mouseover event fired?
    When mouse is moved over a new element

    what is hoisting
    code execution before declarations. access them before they are declared. One of the benefits of hoisting is that it enables us 
    to call functions before they appear in the code. 

    What does != Mean in programming?
    not-equal-to operator. The not-equal-to operator ( != ) returns true if the operands don't have the same value; otherwise, it 
    returns false

    What is ++i in JavaScript? (bad ki Value)
        ++i is the value of i after the increment. 
            i = 42;
            alert(++i); // shows 43
            alert(i); // shows 43

    What is i++ in JavaScript? (Pehle ki value)
        The value i++ is the value of i before the increment.
            var i = 42;
            alert(i++); // shows 42
            alert(i); // shows 43

    diff between =, ==, ===
        = => assigning value
        == => comparing values
        === => comparing values and types

    what is array in javascript?
    array is collection of data. access  from index value. array can hold function. array is numeric index number. 
    in javascript array start with 0 (zero) index number. in single variable store multiple value is called
    array. ex:  var myArr = [1, 2, 'a', 'c'];

    split() => convert string to array, return new array. Not change original string.

    let text = "How are you doing today?";
    const arr = text.split(" ", 4); // ["How", "are", "you", "doing"]

    at();
    arr.at(2); // "you"; -> 2nd position value
    arr.at(); // "How"; -> First Value
    arr.at(-1); // "doing"; -> Last value

    what is object in javascript
    object is key value pair. access from .(dot) notation. object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association 
    between a key and a value.
        var myOb = {
            name: "cyclopes",
            rank: '2',
            power: ['one', 'two', 'three']
        }

    what is properties?
    properties are like variable attached to classes / object.

    what is method?
        methods are like function attached to classes / objects

    what destructuring?
    easily extract array element or object properties and store them in variables. Its allows to put out single elements or object 
    properties.

    What does callback function do?
    function call another function is called callback function. ex: setTimeout(), setInterval();
    A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to 
    complete some kind of routine or action.

    what is this keyword in javascript?
    The JavaScript this keyword refers to the object it belongs to. It has different values depending on where it is used: In a method, 
    this refers to the owner object. Alone, this refers to the global object. In a function, this refers to the global object.

   Difference Between JavaScript and TypeScript
    JavaScript is a scripting language used to make web pages interactive. It is flexible and runs directly in all browsers. However,
     because it is loosely typed, errors often appear only when the code is running, which can sometimes cause bugs.

    TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft. It adds static typing and other features to help catch errors before
     the code runs. TypeScript code needs to be compiled into JavaScript before it can run in a browser.

    Key points to remember:
        JavaScript runs directly in browsers, while TypeScript requires compilation to JavaScript.
        JavaScript is flexible but can lead to runtime errors.
        TypeScript is stricter, helping developers write safer and more maintainable code.
        JavaScript detects errors at runtime; TypeScript catches errors during development.
        TypeScript supports object-oriented programming concepts and provides better tooling.
        JavaScript is ideal for small to medium projects; TypeScript is especially helpful for large-scale applications.


    Compiler - Preparer
        Translates code from one language into another, usually from high-level code (like TypeScript or C++) into low-level machine code or another high-level language.
        Converts your whole code into another language before it runs.
        Example: TypeScript gets compiled into JavaScript.
        👉 Like writing a full letter in English, then translating the whole letter into Hindi before giving it to someone.
        - Checks for syntax and type errors.
        - Optimizes and converts it into another form (often binary or JavaScript).

    Interpreter - Live Reader
     An interpreted scripting language like JavaScript is a programming language that:
     Does not need to be compiled into machine code before running. Instead, it is executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime.
        Reads and runs your code line by line, as it goes.
        Example: JavaScript runs directly in the browser.
        👉 Like someone reading a sentence in English, then immediately speaking it in Hindi.

    Transformer - Rewriter
        Runs the code line-by-line without creating a separate output file.
        - No separate compiled file is created.
        - x`Errors show up at runtime.

        Changes the way code looks but keeps its meaning.
        Example: Babel turns modern JavaScript into old JavaScript so old browsers can understand it.
        👉 Like rewriting fancy English into simple English.


    Is TypeScript frontend or backend?
    Typescript is a programming language. You can use it for front end development (eg Angular) or backend development using Node js environment.

    what is class inheritance in javascript
    Inheritance enables you to define a class that takes all the functionality from a parent class and allows you to add more.
    Using class inheritance, a class can inherit all the methods and properties of another class.


    what is filter method  in javascript?
    The filter() method does not change the original array. Its return array values.
    The filter() function will return a new array containing all the array elements that pass the given condition. If no elements pass 
    the condition it returns an empty array.

        Let's go through step by step on how the filter() works.
            Create an empty array filterArr .
            Loop through the array elements.
            Called the filterFunc function with the current element as the argument.
            If the result is true, push the element to the filterArr array.
            Return filterArr array after going through all the elements.

    Spread Operator
    The spread operator ... is used to expand or spread an iterable or an array. ou can also use the spread syntax ... to copy the items 
    into a single array.

    what is map method  in javascript?

    what is reduce method in javascript?
    The reduce method is applied to arrays in Javascript. reduce() method returns a single value

    what is promises in javascript?
    A promise in JavaScript is asynchronous, meaning it takes time to resolve or finish.
    A Promise represents something that is eventually fulfilled. A Promise can either be rejected or resolved based on the operation outcome.
    The code does not directly or immediately return a value.
    
    What is the difference between observable and promises?
    The biggest difference is that Promises won't change their value once they have been fulfilled. They can only emit (reject, resolve) a single
    value. On the other hand, observables can emit multiple results. The subscriber will be receiving results until the observer is completed or 
    unsubscribed from.
    

    what is async await in javascript?

==> TYPE SCRIPT -----------------------------
    what is type script?
    typescript is not entirely new language, typescript super set of javascript that means any valid javascript code is also valid
    typescript code but typescript have additional features that do not exist in current version of javascript supported.
    typescript strong or static typing like #c and java language.
