==> HTML -------------------------------------
HTML	Tim Berners-Lee 1990

=> HTML
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is coding, but it is not scripting, nor is it programming. It's a markup language. 
It is a language of World Wide Web.

Does a <!DOCTYPE html> tag is a HTML tag
No, the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is not an HTML tag. 
<!DOCTYPE html> is used to instruct the web browser about the HTML page.

What Is The < !doctype > ? Is It Necessary To Use In Html5 ?
The <!DOCTYPE> is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in and The <!DOCTYPE> tag does 
not have an end tag and It is not case sensitive.

If I do not put <!DOCTYPE html> will HTML 5 work?
No, the browser will not be able to identify that it is an HTML document and HTML 5 tags do not function properly

What happens when DOCTYPE is not given?
The web page is rendered in quirks mode. The web browsers engines use quirks mode to support older browsers which does not follow 
the W3C spec. In quirks mode CSS class and id names are case insensitive. In standards mode they are case sensitive.

What does a DOCTYPE do?
DOCTYPE is an abbreviation for DOCument TYPE.
A DOCTYPE is always associated to a DTD for Document Type Definition. it controls whether the browsers uses "standards" or "quirks"
mode to render the document. Once a user agent has recognized a correct DOCTYPE, it will trigger the no-quirks mode matching this 
DOCTYPE for reading the document. If a user agent doesn't recognize a correct DOCTYPE, it will trigger the quirks mode.

What's the difference between standards mode and quirks mode?
Quirks mode was to support websites built before standards became widely implemented. quirks mode in browser allows u to render 
page for as old browsers. This is for backward compatibility.

What is the use of an iframe tag?
An iframe is used to display a web page within a web page.
The IFrame HTML element is often used to insert content from another source, such as an advertisement, into a Web page.

W3C	
W3C stands for World Wide Web Consortium. Its purpose is to deliver the information of the World Wide Web. It also develops
rules and guidelines for the Web.

Why you would like to use semantic tag. Why Semantic HTML is Important?
A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

Search Engine Optimization, accessibility, repurposing, light code. Many visually impaired person rely on browser speech and 
semantic tag helps to interpret page content clearly. Search engine needs to understand page content to rank and semantic tag helps.
Semantic HTML is the practice of using more descriptive and meaningful tags when coding in HTML. A tag is simply anything you use to
wrap content in. Some of the most common are <h1>, <header>, <footer>, <p>, <section>, <nav>, and <div>.

what is meta tag 
The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document
metadata describes the contents of a Web page. the meta tags don't appear on the page itself, but only in the page's 
source code.Meta tags are  essentially little, content, descriptors that help tell search engines what a web page is about.
Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), and other web services

What is favicon?
They are a small graphic that represents the website.

what is components
component = element block on UI

what is layout
the layout is the page's skeleton in which you inject components.

What is accessibility of a website?
Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible. By making your website accessible, 
you are ensuring that all of your potential users, including people with disabilities. We traditionally think of this as being
about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile 
devices, or those with slow network connections.

By making your website accessible, you are ensuring that all of your potential users, including people with disabilities, have a 
decent user experience and are able to easily access your information.

What do you understand by accessibility?
enabling access for people with disabilities.
Common accessibility features include text-to-speech, closed-captioning, and keyboard shortcuts.
Common examples of important accessibility features include: Image alt text. Keyboard accessibility
Accessibility can be viewed as the "ability to access" and benefit from some system or entity. The concept focuses on enabling 
access for people with disabilities, or enabling access through the use of assistive technology; however, research and development 
in accessibility brings benefits to everyone.

What do we mean by accessibility?
Accessibility refers to how software or hardware combinations are designed to make a system accessible to persons with disabilities,
such as visual impairment, hearing loss, or limited dexterity.

Accessibility means that people can do what they need to do in a similar amount of time and effort as someone that does not have a
disability. It means that people are empowered, can be independent, and will not be frustrated by something that is poorly designed
or implemented

What Is A CSS Reset? (make consistency on all browser so reset default values)
resets the styling of all HTML elements to a consistent baseline
CSS resets aim to remove all built-in browser styling. For example margins, paddings, font-sizes of all elements are reset to be
 the same. 

    In case you didn’t know, every browser has its own default ‘user agent’ stylesheet, that it uses to make unstyled 
    websites appear more legible. For example, most browsers by default make links blue and visited links purple, give
    tables a certain amount of border and padding, apply variable font-sizes to H1, H2, H3 etc. and a certain amount of
    padding to almost everything. Ever wondered why Submit buttons look different in every browser?

what is opacity in css
The CSS opacity property is used to specify the transparency of an element.

what is margin in css
used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders

what is padding in css
padding is the space between an element's border and the element's content.

What is the difference between a class and an ID?
Class is a way of using HTML elements for styling. They are not unique and have multiple elements.  
ID is unique and it can be assigned to a single element. 

Is CSS faster than sass?
CSS sends an HTTP request to server each time to import a file. Sass does it without an HTTP request, which is a faster approach.

in button 
we have to use (padding)em instead of px and for margin rem consistence spacing. in rem, R stand for root. pixels are solid unit 
they are not changed.

Explicit and Implicit Grid
When we use grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows we create an Explicit Grid. However if we try and place an item outside of 
that grid the browser will create an Implicit Grid line or lines in order to hold that item.

CSS Flexbox or Grid ?
Flexbox is mainly meant for 1-dimensional layouts while Grid is meant for 2-dimensional layouts.

Flexbox
It comes in handy when you need to create a responsive web design.
Flexbox is a CSS3 layout model that solves usually tricky problems including how to position, center or dynamically resize elements
on a page. it a great tool to use for responsive design systems.

What is grid area CSS?
The grid-area CSS shorthand property specifies a grid item's size and location within a grid by contributing a line, a span

Does CSS grid replace Flexbox?
Grid is better than flexbox for a number of valid points. Furthermore, Grid uses the auto layout, minmax(), repeat(), and auto-fill
which can provide responsive media query alternative. Flexbox is essentially for laying out items in a single dimension – in a 
row OR a column

What Are Pseudo-elements?
Pseudo-elements are fictional elements that do not exist in HTML.

What you mean by pseudo classes in CSS?
Pseudo classes will allow you to identify the HTML elements
Pseudo class is a style element. It works when the element goes on focus like when we mouse over a button, and it changes its color

What is a Clearfix?
A clearfix is a way for an element to automatically clear or fix its elements, so that do not need to add additional markup. It is
generally used in float layout where elements are floated to be stacked horizontally.
 .clearfix::after {
        content: "";
        clear: both;
        display: table;
    }

Z index helps in specifying the overlapping element. It is a number which can be positive or negative, the default value being zero.

What is aspect ratio CSS?
The aspect ratio of an element describes the proportional relationship between its width and its height. ratio value representing 
the width-to-height aspect ratio of the viewport. It is a range feature, meaning you can also use the prefixed min-aspect-ratio and 
max-aspect-ratio variants to query minimum and maximum  values, respectively.

width: max-content;
    not wrap

visibility hidden vs display none
    is not visible, but space is allocated for it on the page.

List out some of the properties in added in CSS3?
Border Images, New Web fonts, Multi Column layout, Box Shadows, Text Shadows, Transform property, Word-wrap, Text-overflow, 
Word- break

PX: Pixels (px) are considered absolute units, although they are relative to the DPI and resolution of the viewing device. But on
the device itself, the PX unit is fixed and does not change based on any other element. Using PX can be problematic for responsive
sites, but they are useful for maintaining consistent sizing for some elements. If you have elements that should not be resized, 
then using PX is a good choice.
EM: Relative to the parent element
REM: Relative to the root element (HTML tag) [R stands for root]
%: Relative to the parent element
VW: Relative to the viewport’s width
VH: Relative to the viewport’s height

What is the difference between em and rem units?
em units inherit their value from the nearest parent element
rem units inherit their value from the root element (html)
In most browsers, the font-size of the root element is set to 16px by default.

What is the difference between REM and em and px?
px is not scalable, it is an absolute unit. ... Element ( em ) and Root element ( rem ) are responsive units interpreted into
equivalent px unit by the browser. em is Relative to the parent element, rem Relative to the root element

What is the difference between span and div?
div is a block element and span is inline element.

What is the origin of CSS?
SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) 

What's the difference between a relative, fixed, absolute and statically positioned element?
static - The default position; the element will flow into the page as it normally would. relative - The element's position is 
    adjusted relative to itself, without changing layout 
absolute - The element is removed from the flow of the page and positioned at a specified position relative to its closest 
    positioned ancestor if any.
fixed - The element is removed from the flow of the page and positioned at a specified position relative to the viewport and 
    doesn't move when scrolled.
sticky - Sticky positioning is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. The element is treated as relative positioned until 
    it crosses a specified threshold, at which point it is treated as fixed positioned.

What is transition all in CSS?

what is word-break?
how words should break when reaching the end of a line.
    word-break: normal|break-all|keep-all|break-word|initial|inherit;

what is outline?
Outline differs from borders! Unlike border, the outline is drawn outside the element's border, and may overlap other content. 
Also, the outline is NOT a part of the element's dimensions; the element's total width and height is not affected by the width 
of the outline.

font-kerning
Kerning defines how letters are spaced.For fonts that do not include kerning data, this property will have no visible effect.

What do you understand by tweening in CSS?
Tweening is the process of filling the gaps between the key sequences, i.e between the keyframes that are already created. Keyframes
are those frames that represent start and end point of animation action. Tweening involves generating intermediate keyframes between
two images that give the impression that the first one has evolved smoothly to the second image. For this purpose, we use properties
like  transforms - matrix, translate, scale, rotate etc.

What is RWD?
RWD is the abbreviated form of Responsive Web Design. It is used to display the designed page suitably on any kind of screen size 
depending on the device under consideration.

What is difference between ID selector and class selector in CSS?
“id” is unique in a page and can only apply to at most one element, while “class” selector can apply to multiple elements.
id is used for single elements that appear on the page for only once (e.g. header, footer, menu), whereas class is used for 
single or multiple elements that appear on the page for once or more than once 



::before / ::after
  The ::before and ::after pseudo-elements in CSS allows you to insert content onto a page without it needing to be in the HTML.
  While the end result is not actually in the DOM

:active
  The :active pseudo selector changes the appearance of a link while it is being activated (being clicked on or otherwise activated).
  It’s usually only seen for a split second, and provides visual feedback that the element was indeed clicked.

:any-link
  The :any-link pseudo-class in CSS provides a method for selecting elements that are the source anchor of a hyperlink.An element 
  that accepts and contains a href attribute is a hyperlink and will be selected with :any-link. This becomes a handy way of 
  selecting all link.
  :matches(:link, :visited) will select the same elements as :any-link.
  :-webkit-any-link {
  }

:blank (no support)
  The :blank pseudo-class builds upon the :empty pseudo-class. Like :empty, :blank will select elements that contain nothing at all,
  or contain only an HTML comment. But, :blank will also select elements that include whitespace, which :empty will not.
  :-moz-only-whitespace

:empty
   select elements that contain either nothing

:dir() -(only firefox support)
  :dir(rtl) {}

:disabled / :enabled
  used in input 
  <input type="text" disabled>

::first-letter

:first-of-type  /  :last-of-type
  allows you to target the first occurence of an element within its container.

:in-range /   :out-of-range
  in CSS matches input elements when their value is within the range specified as being acceptable.
  <input max="10" min="5" type="number">

:indeterminate
  selector in CSS named for a state that is neither checked nor unchecked. It’s that in-between state that we might consider 
  the “Maybe” between “Yes” and “No” options. The state is not fully determined, hence the name: indeterminate.

:is / :where
    both pseudo-class functions that can help shorten and stop repetition in creating your selectors.
  The pseudo-select :is() in CSS allows you to write compound selectors more tersely.
  ul li, ol li {}
    :is(ul, ol) li {}
  ul li a:hover, ol li a:hover {}
    :is(ul li, ol li) a:hover{}

What is the difference between :is & :where?
    they have different specificities. :where() is simple and always has a specificity of 0 while :is() 
    has the specificity of the strongest/most specific selector.

==> SASS -----------------------------
What is SASS programming?
Sass (First appeared	November 28, 2006, latest version 3.5. 7 - July 18, 2018 (313 KB))
Sass (which stands for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is an extension to CSS. ... Saas includes various features such as 
variables, nested rules, mixins, inline imports, built-in functions to manipulate color and other values, all with a fully 
CSS-compatible syntax. Sass is a style sheet language initially designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum. 
Sass is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). SassScript is the 
scripting language itself. Sass consists of two syntaxes. The original syntax, called "the indented syntax," uses a syntax similar
 to Haml.

What is the benefit of using sass?
Advantages. Sass facilitates you to write clean, easy and less CSS in a programming construct. It contains fewer codes so you can 
write CSS quicker.It is more stable, powerful, and elegant because it is an extension of CSS.

What is a Sass mixin?
Mixins allow you to define styles that can be re-used throughout your stylesheet.
Mixins allow you to group multiple lines of code together that you can reuse throughout your code.
   @mixin horizontal-list { }
    nav ul { @include horizontal-list; }

What is the difference between SCSS and sass?
The basic difference is the syntax. While SASS has a loose syntax with white space and no semicolons, the SCSS resembles more to 
CSS. SASS stands for Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets. SCSS --Sassy CSS

What is the use of Sass @import function?
SASS @import directive is used to include one stylesheet inside another stylesheet

What is the use of @extend function in Sass?
By using @extend function same style can be copied to the other classes also and there is no need to rewrite the code again.
   
Explain how to define a variable in Sass?
Variables in Sass begin with a ($) sign and variable assignment is done with a colon(:).

Explain when can you use the %placeholders in Sass?
%placeholders in Sass is useful when you want to write styles that were meant to be extended, but you don’t want the base styles 
to be seen in output CSS styles

Explain what is the use of &combinator ?
&combinator concatenates nested selector with the parent selector.

Partials and Importing
SASS partials allow us to break up our files into smaller files. We can essentially modularize CSS to make more maintainable code. 
You can create a partial file that only contains relevant code per section. This is useful if your SASS file is getting too large.


What is the advantage of sass?
Sass reduces repetition of CSS and therefore saves time. Sass facilitates you to write clean, easy and less CSS in a programming 
construct. It contains fewer codes so you can write CSS quicker. It is more stable, powerful, and elegant because it is an extension
 of CSS.

The disadvantages of CSS preprocessors
    # 1. Debugging is harder. ...
    # 2. Compilation slows down development. ...
    # 3. They can produce very large CSS files. ...
    # 4. Maintainence and overengineering. ...
    # 5. Tooling and developer convenience. ...
    # 6. Saving generated files (or not) ...
    # 7. Capability and understanding. ...




==> JQUERY -----------------------------

What is jQuery and why it is used?
Introduced in 2006, jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.  It is free, open-source.
The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.
 jQuery makes event handling, DOM manipulation, Ajax calls much easier than JavaScript.
 jQuery also allows us to add animated effects on our web page which takes a lot of pain and lines of code with JavaScript.

jQuery is a small yet feature-rich powerful javascript library that helps to manipulate the HTML DOM with less javascript code.


Is Jquery Code Executed On The Client side, Or Server side?
Answer : Client side

window.onload() - https://www.dotnetbull.com/2013/08/document-ready-vs-window-onload.html
The load event fires when all the content on your page fully loaded including the DOM 
(document object model) content, asynchronous javascript, frames and images

$(window).load(function () { alert("window load complete"); });
window.onload = function () {alert("window load complete"); }

$document.ready() -
Jquery $document.ready function event executes a bit earlier than window.onload and called once the  DOM(Document object model) is
 loaded on your page. DOM means all the html tags/script  I.e.(anchor tag, table, div tag, paragraph tag etc..). It will not wait 
 for the images, frames to get fully load. It means that it is the earliest stage in page load process.

The main difference is that $document.ready() event gets called as soon as your DOM is loaded.  It does not wait for the contents 
to get loaded fully. For example, there are very heavy images  on any web page and takes time to load. If you have used window.onload
then it will wait until  all your images are loaded fully, hence it slows down the execution. On the other side,  $document.ready()
does not wait for elements to get loaded.

What’s the difference between window.onload vs document.onload?
window.onload is fired when the DOM is ready and all the content including images, CSS, scripts, subframes, etc. finish loaded.
It means that everything is loaded.
document.onload is fired when the DOM is ready, which can be before images and other external content is loaded.

Is Ajax a framework?
    AJAX. OOP, an open source framework, it provides an OOP-style programming engine and Ajax requests-handling functionality

    $.ajax({
        url: '',
        type: 'get',
        error: function(e){ console.log(e);},
        success: function(res){
            console.log(res);
        }
    });

 What’s the fastest way to query DOM?
    The fastest way to select an element is by ID if the ID exists.
    The second quickest is getElementByClassName .
    The longer the selector, the slower it will be.
    querySelectorAll will be the slowest since it has to search for all kinds of CSS selectors.
    Other methods like getElementById and getElementsByTagName only search for specific kinds of selectors.

What is GET Method? 
GET is used to request data from a specified resource. It appends form-data to the URL in name/ value pairs. The length of the URL
is limited by 2048 characters. This method must not be used if you have a password or some sensitive information to be sent to the
server. It is used for submitting the form where the user can bookmark the result.
    GET requests can be cached
    GET requests remain in the browser history
    GET requests can be bookmarked
    GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data
    GET requests have length restrictions
    GET requests are only used to request data (not modify)

What is POST Method? 
POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.
    POST requests are never cached
    POST requests do not remain in the browser history
    POST requests cannot be bookmarked
    POST requests have no restrictions on data length



==> JAVASCRIPT -----------------------------

What is JavaScript and why it is used?
JavaScript is a very powerful client-side and server-side scripting language.This allows us to create dynamic content for the web. JavaScript is a 
lightweight language that is open-source and allows cross-platform.it works with various other programming languages And this is 
the reason for its vast use all around the world.

the code is always visible to everyone anyone can view JavaScript code

var
var is function scoped, can be re-declared and re-assign. access 'var' before initialization gives 'undefined' (means hoisting)

    console.log(a); // hoisting 
    var a = 10;
    var a = 20; // re-declared
    a = 30; // re-assigning

let 
block level scope, can not re-declared but re-assign. let variables can be updated but not re-declared.Cannot access 'let' before 
initialization gives 'error' (means hoisting)

const 
block level scope, const variables can neither be re-assign nor re-declared. Cannot access 'const' before initialization gives 
'error' (means hoisting)

function 
function is just a basically collection of code that perform a specific task.It is a group of reusable code that you can use
 anywhere in the code. It helps you to divide a large program into small and manageable functions.

    Function Expressions
        variable = function (parameters){ //expression };



Is Const faster than let?
It appears that using const would inherently make code a little faster, because it seems to reduce the amount of hoisting necessary. 

What Are Javascript Types?
Number, String, Boolean, Function, Object, Null, Undefined.

What Is A Prompt Box?
A prompt box allows the user to enter input by providing a text box.

What Is The Difference Between An Alert Box And A Confirmation Box?
An alert box displays only one button which is the OK button whereas the Confirm box displays two buttons namely OK and cancel.

What Does "1"+2+4 Evaluate To?
Since 1 is a string, everything is a string, so the result is 124.

How Do You Convert Numbers to String In Javascript?
Use the  toString()  function

When is the mouseout event fired?
When mouse is no longer over an element

When is the mouseover event fired?
When mouse is moved over a new element

what is hoisting
code execution before declarations. access them before they are declared. One of the benefits of hoisting is that it enables us 
to call functions before they appear in the code. 

What does != Mean in programming?
not-equal-to operator. The not-equal-to operator ( != ) returns true if the operands don't have the same value; otherwise, it 
returns false

What is ++i in JavaScript? (bad ki Value)
    ++i is the value of i after the increment. 
        i = 42;
        alert(++i); // shows 43
        alert(i); // shows 43

What is i++ in JavaScript? (Pehle ki value)
    The value i++ is the value of i before the increment.
        var i = 42;
        alert(i++); // shows 42
        alert(i); // shows 43

diff between =, ==, ===
    = => assigning value
    == => comparing values
    === => comparing values and types

what is array in javascript?
array is collection of data. access  from index value. array can hold function. array is numeric index number. 
in javascript array start with 0 (zero) index number. in single variable store multiple value is called
array. ex:  var myArr = [1, 2, 'a', 'c'];

what is object in javascript
object is key value pair. access from .(dot) notation. object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association 
between a key and a value.
    var myOb = {
        name: "cyclopes",
        rank: '2',
        power: ['one', 'two', 'three']
    }

what is properties?
 properties are like variable attached to classes / object.

what is method?
    methods are like function attached to classes / objects

what destructuring?
easily extract array element or object properties and store them in variables. Its allows to put out single elements or object 
properties.

What does callback function do?
function call another function is called callback function. ex: setTimeout(), setInterval();
A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to 
complete some kind of routine or action.

what is this keyword in javascript?
The JavaScript this keyword refers to the object it belongs to. It has different values depending on where it is used: In a method, 
this refers to the owner object. Alone, this refers to the global object. In a function, this refers to the global object.

difference between typescript and javascript ?
JavaScript is a scripting language. 
typescript  is an object-oriented programming language and has a compiler.
TypeScript is an object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft Corporation, whereas JavaScript is the programming language 
for the web. TypeScript is an open-source language to build large-scale web apps, whereas JavaScript is a server-side programming language
 that helps to develop interactive web pages.

Is TypeScript frontend or backend?
Typescript is a programming language. You can use it for front end development (eg Angular) or backend development using Node js environment.

what is class inheritance in javascript
Inheritance enables you to define a class that takes all the functionality from a parent class and allows you to add more.
Using class inheritance, a class can inherit all the methods and properties of another class.


what is filter method  in javascript?
The filter() method does not change the original array. Its return array values.
The filter() function will return a new array containing all the array elements that pass the given condition. If no elements pass 
the condition it returns an empty array.

    Let's go through step by step on how the filter() works.
        Create an empty array filterArr .
        Loop through the array elements.
        Called the filterFunc function with the current element as the argument.
        If the result is true, push the element to the filterArr array.
        Return filterArr array after going through all the elements.


what is map method  in javascript?

what is reduce method in javascript?
 The reduce method is applied to arrays in Javascript. reduce() method returns a single value

what is promises in javascript?
A promise in JavaScript is asynchronous, meaning it takes time to resolve or finish.
A Promise represents something that is eventually fulfilled. A Promise can either be rejected or resolved based on the operation outcome.
The code does not directly or immediately return a value.

what is async await in javascript?

async/await vs promises javascript?

what is await and async in javascript ?
async makes a function return a Promise. await makes a function wait for a Promise.

what is bubbling in javascript ?

Explain Closures in JavaScript?

What are object prototypes?


What is the difference between observable and promises?
The biggest difference is that Promises won't change their value once they have been fulfilled. They can only emit (reject, resolve) a single
value. On the other hand, observables can emit multiple results. The subscriber will be receiving results until the observer is completed or 
unsubscribed from.



==> ANGULAR -----------------------------

What is angular?
Angular is open source of JavaScript framework. Single page application with multiple views. Angular is written in type script. 
It's maintained by Google.Angular helps build interactive and dynamic single page applications (SPAs) with its compelling 
features including templating,  two-way binding, modularization, RESTful API handling, dependency injection, and AJAX handling.


Property Binding => Property Binding one directional. Means made changes on .ts file reflect on .html file.
    sIt share values between components.

One way binding => In one way binding data flows from one direction. Either from view to component or from component to view.

Two way binding =>  It's use for sharing data .html to .ts or .ta to .html file. With two way binding change values simultaneously.

template Expression => The content inside the double braces is called Template Expression = {{ templateExpression }}


Component
Component is a basic block of content that represent  specific view.

Decorator
  With input decorator we can get data from component to component
  Create own event like click with output() and event emitter. With output() pass custom event from child component to parent component.
 
    Input decorator
      Takes values pass from parent to child component and store that value on child component.

    Output decorator
      Pass data from child to parent component.
      It's happening on some event so to raise an event output must have type of event emitter.  Which is a class an angular core 
      that use to emit() custom event.

Event emitter =>
    Create custom event with event emitter and with the help of @output we transfer pur event component to component


Directives => 
    Directives are attribute/class that add additional behavior to the elements. With directive we manage forms, lists, styles and
     what users see. 
    Different type of directives
    1. Component directives
    2. Attributes directives - change the appriance or behaviour of the elements.
    3. Structural directives - change the structure of DOM by adding or removing DOM element

    Component directive
    Which is template. This type of directives most common because it's HTML.

    In-built attribute directives
    Listen to modify the behaviour of the elements attributes, properties and components. Ex NgClass, NgStyle, NgModel

    Structural directives
    Structural directive responsible for html layout. Adding, removing and manipulating to the host element.
    *NgIf - conditionally hide and show
    *Ng for - repeat a node each item of the list
    *NgSwitch -  switch alternative views


Constructor
    Constructor runs when object or component initialized 

What's is interface?
    Same as class

Dependencies injection
    Dependencies are services or object with class need to perform its function


What's is service and how to use?
    Service were we write our logic  interacting with our API's.

    Service is just a class. It does bring the injectable and has  injectable decorator and it's provide to the application level

    Import on the component. If we want to use the service then need to add services into the constructor as a provider

What is obervarable?
    Use obeservable because if we dealing with asynchronous  data like fetching data from server.

    import {obervarable, of } from 'rxjs';
    Import "obervarable and of" on the service
    Make obeservable and subscribe() on the component.


Pipes => 
    Pipes are simply function we can use on our template which accept  input value ( parameters) and return a formatted value.
    Pipe use for DATA manipulation. Angular has in-built pipes like uppercase, lowercase, percentage and currency. We can also create 
    custom pipe. Pipe can be provided with argument by using colon ( : ) sign.
    [ ng g pipe pipeName ]


Component Life Cycle Hook => The life cycle hooks are the methods that angular invokes on directives and components as it creates,
     changes, and destroys them.

Module => module is a container for a group of related component every angular app at least one module which we call app module. 
    each module responsible for specific area of our application in that module.  The Components, Templates, Directives, Pipes, 
    and Services, which implements that feature become part of the module. 

Services => Services allow us to create reusable code and use it every component that needs it.

Dependency injection => Dependency injection means injecting or providing the dependencies to a class into it's constructor.
angular has a dependency injection  framework build into it when going to create an instance of a component it can inject the 
dependencies but in order for that to work we need to register these dependencies somewhere in our module.  

Router => The Router module handles the navigation.The Routing allows you to move from one View to another View.  

Data Binding => The Component passes the data to the view using a process called Data Binding.


ngOnInit void => 
    It is life cycle method.It runs on load.
    void means it does not return anything. We can write onload functions on ngOnInit.

Typescript
    Typescript is not internary language.
    Typescript is super set of JavaScript. That means Any valid JavaScript code also valid typescript code.
    But typescript some additional features do not existing on current JavaScript


Life cycle hooks
    In angular, every component has lifecycle. Angular create and renders these components and also destroy them before removing 
    from the DOM. This is achieve with the help of lifecycle hook.
    ngOnChanges( ) - data set or re-set data bound input properties.
    ngOnInit( ) - initialised the component or directives, after the first angular display the data bound property and set the 
    input properties.
    ngDoCheck( ) etc.



Ng Model
    Ng Models are container that reserve a block of code to an workflow.
    @NgModel takes metadata object that describes how to compile the components template and how to create an injector an runtime. 
    Ng models identified modules, services, pipes and directives


Ng content
    Ng content use as a projection to take html into another component.
    With <ng-content> user can present there own content.

Template statements
    Template statements is response on event raise by target like element, component or a directive. 



Controller
Angular controllers control the data of  angular application. They are regular JavaScript objects. The ng-conroller defines the 
application controller.





What are advantages of angular?
    Functionality, Consistency, Productivity, Maintainability, Modular development structure, Angular Material.

Who is using angular?
    Microsoft Office, Deutsche Bank, Mixer, Santander, Gmail, Forbes, Upwork, PayPal.


Why you should not use angular?
    The biggest drawback of Angular was poor accessibility for page scrapers and search crawlers

What are the advantages of Angular?
    Two-way data binding.
    DOM manipulation, 
    Improved server performance, 
    Faster application prototyping, 
    Responsive web, 
    Highly testable products, 
    The MVVM architecture, 
    Use of directives.

What are the disadvantages of Angular?
    SEO problems,
    Concept of Dependency Injection and Inversion Of Control,

why not jquery use in angular?

Encapsulation




==> TYPE SCRIPT -----------------------------
what is type script?
typescript is not entirely new language, typescript super set of javascript that means any valid javascript code is also valid
typescript code but typescript have additional features that do not exist in current version of javascript supported.
typescript strong or static typing like #c and java language.

Access modifiers
    1. Public
    2. Private
    3. Protected

constructor
        class Human {
           public FName: string;
           private LName: string;
            constructor(FName?: string, LName?: string) {
                this.FirstName = FName,
                    this.LastName = LName,
                    this.sayHello = function () {
                        console.log(`Hello, I'm ${this.FirstName} ${LName}`);
                    }
            }
            fullName(){
                console.log(this.FName + " " + this.LName);
            }
        }
        //const person = new Human('Kakashi', 'Hatake');
        const person = new Human();
        person.FName = 'Mike';
        console.log(person.sayHello());



==> META TAGS -----------------------------

Viewport <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
Viewport meta tag is necessary because it instructs web browsers (mainly mobile web browsers) on how to render a webpage on all 
devices.

Author and Copyright 
<meta name="author" content="Name of the author" />
<meta name="copyright" content="Copyright information" />
Author and copyright met tags are used to record information such as the creator of the website and the copyright ownership 
information.

Robots
Robots meta tag is used to provide index information to search engine crawlers. The following meta tags are used to determine 
whether a page is available for a web search 
<meta name="robots" content="follow"/>

Index:
This allows the web crawlers to index your webpage. The value follow also makes sure that any outgoing hyperlinks are also crawled.
<meta name="robots" content="follow"/>

Noindex
It is the opposite of Index. It tells web crawlers not to index your webpage.
<meta name="robots" content="noindex"/>

Nofollow
It prevents web crawlers from indexing outgoing hyperlinks on your web page.
<meta name="robots" content="nofollow"/>

Character encoding  <meta charset="UTF-8">
Web browsers understand need the character encoding information to display a webpage correctly. To define the character encoding 
we use charset attribute and assign it with an appropriate value. The most common character encoding used is the UTF-8. We use
UTF-8 because it has more than 10,000 characters.

Http equivalents
http-equivalents attribute is used to include information that is usually contained in HTTP header. It is used to control cache 
information,
 expiration date, refresh page redirection and much more.


Cache control
When we use the meta tag “cache-control” with the value “no-cache”, we prevent caching of the webpage and that means the webpage 
is reloaded for every page view. This may lead to longer loading times but is helpful in cases where webpage is being updated 
frequently. 
<meta http-equiv="cache-control" content="no-cache"/>

Expires
We can set expiry date for the webpage data instead of preventing caching completely.
<meta http-equiv="expires" content="4500"/>
<meta http-equiv="expires" content="Thu, 06 Aug 2020 20:13:13 GMT"/>

Refresh
Instead of using complicated ways of redirecting web pages using JavaScript or other programming languages. HTML provides a much
 more succinct and simple solution. To redirect a webpage, we need three attributes set to:
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="time(seconds); url=http://www.your-website.com/"/>

Keywords
We can search using keywords in a search engine. Searching using keywords will show the internet user web webpages with keywords
 corresponding to their search.
<meta name="keywords" content="keyword #1, keyword #2, keyword #3"/>
