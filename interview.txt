91.  Define CSS image sprites.
Answer: CSS image sprites are a group of images that are placed into one image. It reduces the load time and request number to the server 
while projecting multiple images into a single web page. Each image would have a corresponding CSS class with background-image, 
background-position and background-size properties defined.

    --Advantages:
    Reduce the number of HTTP requests for multiple images (only one single request is required per spritesheet). But with HTTP2, 
    loading multiple images is no longer much of an issue.
    Advance downloading of assets that won't be downloaded until needed, such as images that only appear upon :hover pseudo-states.
    Blinking wouldn't be seen.
    When you have multiple images/ icons, browser makes separate call to the server for each one of them. sprite is a technique to 
    combine all/ some of them (usually similar one in terms of type of image. For example, you will put jpg in one sprite) in one image. 
    To display the icon you set height, width and background position.

    --Alternatives:
        Data URIs - allow you to embed the image data directly into a stylesheet. This avoids additional HTTP requests for images, 
        making it essentially the same thing as a sprite, without the fancy positioning.
