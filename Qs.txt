------------- HTML---------------
!DOCTYPE
    the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is not an HTML tag. 
    <!DOCTYPE html> is used to instruct the web browser about the HTML page.
    The <!DOCTYPE> is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. 
    AND The <!DOCTYPE> tag does not have an end tag and It is not case sensitive.

 What does a DOCTYPE do?
    DOCTYPE is an abbreviation for DOCument TYPE.
    A DOCTYPE is always associated to a DTD for Document Type Definition. it controls whether the browsers uses 
    "standards" or "quirks" mode to render the document.
    Once a user agent has recognized a correct DOCTYPE, it will trigger the no-quirks mode matching this DOCTYPE for reading the document.
     If a user agent doesn't recognize a correct DOCTYPE, it will trigger the quirks mode.


 What happens when DOCTYPE is not given?
    The web page is rendered in quirks mode. The web browsers engines use quirks mode to support older browsers which does not follow
     the W3C spec.In quirks mode CSS class and id names are case insensitive. In standards mode they are case sensitive.

* ----------- Pseudo-elements
::after / ::before, - ::first-letter, - ::first-line, - ::selection,- :placeholder

* ----------- Pseudo-classes
 placeholder-shown, :active, :checked, :disabled, :last-child, :nth-child(n), :not(selector), :valid, :target, :required, 
 :read-only, :only-of-type, :nth-of-type(n), :nth-last-of-type(n), :nth-last-child(n), :link


::before / ::after
  The ::before and ::after pseudo-elements in CSS allows you to insert content onto a page without it needing to be in the HTML.
  While the end result is not actually in the DOM

:active
  The :active pseudo selector changes the appearance of a link while it is being activated (being clicked on or otherwise activated). 
  It’s usually only seen for a split second, and provides visual feedback that the element was indeed clicked.

:any-link
  The :any-link pseudo-class in CSS provides a method for selecting elements that are the source anchor of a hyperlink.An element that 
  accepts and contains a href attribute is a hyperlink and will be selected with :any-link. This becomes a handy way of selecting all link.
  :matches(:link, :visited) will select the same elements as :any-link.
  :-webkit-any-link {
  }

:blank (no support)
  The :blank pseudo-class builds upon the :empty pseudo-class. Like :empty, :blank will select elements that contain nothing at all,
  or contain only an HTML comment. But, :blank will also select elements that include whitespace, which :empty will not.
  :-moz-only-whitespace

:empty
  The :empty pseudo selector will select elements that contain either nothing

:dir() -(only firefox support)
  :dir(rtl) {}

:disabled / :enabled
  used in input 
  <input type="text" disabled>

::first-letter
  which allows you to style the first letter in an element.

::first-line
  which allows you to style the first line in an element.

:first-child
  target the first element immediately inside another element.
 
:first-of-type  /  :last-of-type
  allows you to target the first occurence of an element within its container.

:in-range /   :out-of-range
  in CSS matches input elements when their value is within the range specified as being acceptable.
  <input max="10" min="5" type="number">

:indeterminate
  selector in CSS named for a state that is neither checked nor unchecked. It’s that in-between state that we might consider 
  the “Maybe” between “Yes” and “No” options. The state is not fully determined, hence the name: indeterminate.


:is / :where
  The pseudo-select :is() in CSS allows you to write compound selectors more tersely.
  ul li, ol li {}
    :is(ul, ol) li {}
  ul li a:hover, ol li a:hover {}
    :is(ul li, ol li) a:hover{}

::marker
  The ::marker pseudo-element is for styling the stylistic marker of a list element. For example, the bullet point of a 
  default <ul> (e.g. •) or the numeral of a default <ol> (e.g. 1.). 

::placeholder
  allows you to style the placeholder text of a form element.
  ::-webkit-input-placeholder { /* Chrome/Opera/Safari */}
  ::-moz-placeholder { /* Firefox 19+ */}
  :-ms-input-placeholder { /* IE 10+ */}
  :-moz-placeholder { /* Firefox 18- */}

:placeholder-shown
   selects the input element itself when placeholder text exists in a form input.

:root
  The :root selector allows you to target the highest-level “parent” element in the DOM, or document tree.

in button 
    we have to use (padding)em instead of px and for margin rem consistence spacing.
    in rem, M stand for root.
    pixels are solid unit they are not changed.

What is the difference between em and rem units?
    While em is relative to the font-size of its direct or nearest parent, rem is only relative to the html (root) font-size. 
    em gives the ability to control an area of a design. As in, scale the type in that specific area relatively. rem gives
     the ability to scale type across the entire page easily.

Should I use em or REM?
    Use em units for sizing that should scale depending on the font size of an element other than the root. Use rem units 
    for sizing that doesn't need em units, and that should scale depending on browser font size settings.

What is the difference between REM and em and px?
    px is not scalable, it is an absolute unit. ... Element ( em ) and Root element ( rem ) are responsive units 
    interpreted into equivalent px unit by the browser. em is Relative to the parent element, rem Relative to the root element.

PX: Pixels (px) are considered absolute units, although they are relative to the DPI and resolution of the viewing device. But on the device itself, the PX unit is fixed and does not change based on any other element. Using PX can be problematic for responsive sites, but they are useful for maintaining consistent sizing for some elements. If you have elements that should not be resized, then using PX is a good choice.

    EM: Relative to the parent element

    REM: Relative to the root element (HTML tag) [R stands for root]

    %: Relative to the parent element

         closest positioned ancestor if any.
    fixed - The element is removed from the flow of the page and positioned at a specified position relative to the 
            viewport and doesn't move when scrolled.

------------- Jquery ---------------

Is Jquery Code Executed On The Client side, Or Server side?
Answer : Client side

What is jQuery and why it is used?
    Introduced in 2006
    jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library. 
    jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, 
    as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax. It is free, open-source

window.onload() - https://www.dotnetbull.com/2013/08/document-ready-vs-window-onload.html
The load event fires when all the content on your page fully loaded including the DOM 
(document object model) content, asynchronous javascript, frames and images

$(window).load(function () { alert("window load complete"); });

window.onload = function () {alert("window load complete"); }


$document.ready() -
Jquery $document.ready function event executes a bit earlier than window.onload and called once the 
DOM(Document object model) is loaded on your page. DOM means all the html tags/script 
I.e.(anchor tag, table, div tag, paragraph tag etc..). It will not wait for the images, 
frames to get fully load. It means that it is the earliest stage in page load process.

The main difference is that $document.ready() event gets called as soon as your DOM is loaded. 
It does not wait for the contents to get loaded fully. For example, there are very heavy images 
on any web page and takes time to load. If you have used window.onload then it will wait until 
all your images are loaded fully, hence it slows down the execution. On the other side, 
$document.ready() does not wait for elements to get loaded.


what is document.ready() ?
$( document ).ready() will only run once the page Document Object Model (DOM) is ready for JavaScript code to execute.

what is window.onload() ?


.load()
The load event is sent to an element when it and all sub-elements have been completely loaded. 









------------- Javascript -----------
var
    var is function scoped, can be re-declared.
    access 'var' before initialization gives 'undefined' (means hoisting)

    var a = 10;
    var a = 20; // re-declared
    a = 30; // re-assigning

let 
    block level scope, can not re-declared.let variables can be updated but not re-declared.
    Cannot access 'let' before initialization gives 'error' (means hoisting)

const 
    block level scope, can not re-assignment to constant variable. const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared. 
    Cannot access 'const' before initialization gives 'error' (means hoisting)

Is Const faster than let?
    It appears that using const would inherently make code a little faster, because it seems to reduce the amount 
    of hoisting necessary. 

what is hoisting
    code execution before declarations. access them before they are declared.
    One of the benefits of hoisting is that it enables us to call functions before they appear in the code. 

What does != Mean in programming?
    not-equal-to operator
    The not-equal-to operator ( != ) returns true if the operands don't have the same value; otherwise, it returns false

What is ++ i in JavaScript?
    The value of ++i is the value of i after the increment. 
    var i = 42;
    alert(i++); // shows 42
    alert(i); // shows 43
    i = 42;
    alert(++i); // shows 43
    alert(i); // shows 43
      


The difference between i++ and ++i is the value of the expression.
    The value i++ is the value of i before the increment. The value of ++i is the value of i after the increment.
    var i = 42;
    alert(i++); // shows 42
    alert(i); // shows 43
    i = 42;
    alert(++i); // shows 43

------------- meta tags -----------
Viewport <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
Viewport meta tag is necessary because it instructs web browsers (mainly mobile web browsers) on how to render a webpage
 on all devices.

Author and Copyright 
    <meta name="author" content="Name of the author" />
    <meta name="copyright" content="Copyright information" />
    Author and copyright met tags are used to record information such as the creator of the website and the copyright
     ownership information.

Robots
    Robots meta tag is used to provide index information to search engine crawlers. The following meta tags are used to 
    determine whether a page is available for a web search 
    <meta name="robots" content="follow"/>

Index:
    This allows the web crawlers to index your webpage.
    <meta name="robots" content="follow"/>
    The value follow also makes sure that any outgoing hyperlinks are also crawled.

Noindex
    It is the opposite of Index. It tells web crawlers not to index your webpage.
    <meta name="robots" content="noindex"/>

Nofollow
    It prevents web crawlers from indexing outgoing hyperlinks on your web page.
    <meta name="robots" content="nofollow"/>

Character encoding  <meta charset="UTF-8">
    Web browsers understand need the character encoding information to display a webpage correctly. To define the character
     encoding we use charset attribute and assign it with an appropriate value. The most common character encoding used is
      the UTF-8. We use UTF-8 because it has more than 10,000 characters.

Http equivalents
    http-equivalents attribute is used to include information that is usually contained in HTTP header. It is used to control 
    cache information, expiration date, refresh page redirection and much more.


Cache control
    When we use the meta tag “cache-control” with the value “no-cache”, we prevent caching of the webpage and that means the
     webpage is reloaded for every page view. This may lead to longer loading times but is helpful in cases where webpage is being updated frequently.
    <meta http-equiv="cache-control" content="no-cache"/>

Expires
    We can set expiry date for the webpage data instead of preventing caching completely.
    <meta http-equiv="expires" content="4500"/>
    <meta http-equiv="expires" content="Thu, 06 Aug 2020 20:13:13 GMT"/>

Refresh
    Instead of using complicated ways of redirecting web pages using JavaScript or other programming languages. HTML provides
     a much more succinct and simple solution. To redirect a webpage, we need three attributes set to:
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="time(seconds); url=http://www.your-website.com/"/>

Keywords
    We can search using keywords in a search engine. Searching using keywords will show the internet user web webpages with 
    keywords corresponding to their search.
    <meta name="keywords" content="keyword #1, keyword #2, keyword #3"/>
